          <h1>General Tips</h1>
          <p>Before you begin filling out your application, do some research on your job industry requirements, interests, and useful skills (that you either have or need), alot of this info can be found on the About Us page of your job's website. Afterwards, list each criteria for the job in question and try to sort them between "Essential" and "Desirable" before writing the application, if you need an idea of the criteria, you may be able to find them within the job description.
          -While filling out the application, be sure to answer each question honestly to avoid any undesirable results. Finally, complete the application BEFORE the set deadline, the sooner you turn in your application, the better, however, it is just as important to make sure to not rush through the paper</p>
<br>
          <h1>Education</h1>
          <p>Sometimes when you go to write down your past education, you'll find you may not have enough room to put down each one, in this case, it is ok to add an additional paper to the application containing your education, however it is best to only use an extra paper for this section, and only if needed. While writing, do NOT write every detail, instead, summarize the key points and results of your learning and/or the title of the the class, if you are prompted to add additional information, then you may do so.</p>
<br>
          <h1>Job history</h1>
          <p>The best way to list your job history is to put your jobs in reverse chronological order, while listing them, include your job title, name of the organization, and the name of the town the organization was located in.</p>
<br>
          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <p>Try to list hobbies and interests that have a relation to your job pursuit and provide example of how it is linked to your pursuit. another helpful detail to add is a relation to social activity, such as participation in a club rather than just an interest, this shows you are able to interact with people, which is usually sought after by almost every job.</p>
<br>
          <h1>Personal statement</h1>
          <p>The most important thing to note while writing your personal statement, is to stay within the space provided to you, provide enough information to leave them satisfied but not so much that it starts to drag on, all in all, deliver the main point of your message. Whenever you make a statement, provide evidence to prove your statement, hard numbers work the best, such as an increase in sales under your guidance. When you finish your syayement, go back and see if it feels too long, if it does you can turn a few of your points into sub-headings.</p>
<br>
          <h1>References</h1>
          <p>When you are asked to provide references to validate your eligibility, it is good to have at least one or two referees that are work related such as your current line manager. If your a recent graduate of a university you may like to reference an academic from the university, such as a personal tutor. Before you list your referees you <strong>MUST</strong> gain permission from the person beforehand, once thats out of the way, provide the referees full name and title, their postal address, email address, and their phone number, it's always a good idea to keep your referees aware of your career aspirations as well as any of your achievements in the field of work and when you're applying for a new job.</p>
