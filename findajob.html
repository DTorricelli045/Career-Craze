                <h1>Networking</h1>
                <p>If you need some help getting a job, it helps to have a few friends, or acquaintances, or just nice people who have connections to a job you'd like. The essence of networking is having someone else put in a good word for you with their employer so that you have a better chance of scoring an interview with that employer. There are many ways to get into communities that provide networking opportunities, such as classmates from school, past co-workers, any friends that you may know, or even a friend of a friend. Another good way to get in touch with companies and like minded individuals is with networking systems, such as LinkedIn, which help connect you to like minded individuals and companies that you may like. Networking can be a powerful tool in landing the job you desire.</p>
