                <br>
                <p>If you need some help getting a job, it helps to have a few friends, acquaintances, or just nice people who have connections to a job you'd like. The essence of networking is having someone else put in a good word for you with their employer so that you have a better chance of scoring an interview with that employer. There are many ways to get into communities that provide networking opportunities, such as classmates from school, previous co-workers, friends, or even a friend of a friend. Another good way to get in touch with companies and like minded individuals is with networking systems, such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>, which can help connect you to like minded individuals and companies that you may have an interest in someone like you. Networking is a worthwhile venture, as it can become a powerful tool in landing the job you want, so never be afraid to get out there in the world!</p>
