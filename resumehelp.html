            <h2>How To Write A Resume</h2>
            <p>The ever important document to list all your achievements

Keep your resume to a single page

Remember the resume is what nets you an interview, you won't need every little detail to be on this document

Your objective statement is a sentence where you'll describe your goals and achievements (briefly)

Write your skills and accomplishments next, write them breifly and avoid using the word I

write your accomplishments with numbers and fact (EX: increased sales by 15%)

Your job history only has to be from the past 5 years and should be placed in reverse chronological order and include the name of the company and your job title next to each entry

Finally, put down your Education, include the name of your school, the city its located in, and the degree you received at the end of your schooling, remember, you can always go in depth during the interview if necessary

A few extra details to remember;

The 7 second rule; reviewers usually only take 7 seconds to read a resume, make your beginning appealing and keep your resume short to maintain the interest of your potential employers

Keep in mind, more pages, equals less enthusiam from reviewers who read your resume

Don't list your hobbies or personal details (such as appearance)

            <h2>How To Write A Cover Letter</h2>
            <p>A letter to deliver yourself to those looking to hire you

              Begin with your Header, which contains your name, address, phone and e-mail

              consists of a greeting, "dear [insert name]", if the name of the recruiter is unknown put down "dear hiring manager" or "dear recruiting team," or in the worst case, write "To whom it may concern," if you are unsure who will be reading your letter

              the opening paragraph is where you will mention the job you're applying for and how you found the job in question. This should be about 1 or 2 sentences

              Using 1 or 2 body paragraphs will help to keep the hiring manager engaged while also informing them of the needed info, use this space to answer questions such as "why am I qualified for this position?", "What experience do I have that fits the company's requirements as shown in the job listing", and "why do you want to work for this company?"

              For the final paragraph, restate why you're qualified for the job in a single sentence, followed by discussing what you'll be doing next, such as the exact day when you plan on following up with the hiring manager, or that you look forward to interviewing for the position

              Don't forget to mention that your resume and/or references are attached (if you have done so that is), and finally, thank the person for their time

              Finally, end the letter with your closing statement, you should close it like any other letter, such as "Sincerely [your signature here]"
              After writing your letter Review your cover letter for errors
