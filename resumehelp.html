            <h2>How To Write A Resume</h2>
            <p>The resume is the ever important document that lists all your strangths and achievements. 

            While you're writing your resume, keep in mind that it is simplay an introduction of yourself, you won't have to include every little detail about yourself, leave out unnecessary details and condense your information.

            Begin your resume by writing an objective statement that breifly describes your goals and achievements in life. 

            After your objective statement, write about your skills and accomplishments, attempt to write them without using the word "I", for instance, instead of "I was employee of the month" try writing "Elected employee of the month". 

            When writing your accomplishments, write them with facts and numbers to reinforce their validity, such as "Helped increase sales by 15% by providing a detailed sales plan".

            Next, include your job history from around the last 5 years or so, these should be placed in reverse chronlogical order and include the name of the company and your related job title next to each entry.

            Finally, put down your Education, include the name of your school, the city its located in, and the degree you received at the end of your schooling, remember, you can always go in depth during the interview if necessary.

            A few extra details to remember;

            reviewers usually only take 7 seconds to read a resume, make your beginning appealing to keep the reviewers interest, more pages means less interest from the reviewers who read your resume, don't list your hobbies or personal details (such as appearance) when talking about yourself, and finally, try to keep your resume to a single page.

            <h2>How To Write A Cover Letter</h2>
            <p>The cover letter is a formal letter to deliver yourself to those who may be looking to hire you.

              When writing your letter, begin with your Header, which contains your name, address, phone and e-mail.

              Following your heading will be the greeting, the greeting is the same as any other letter, "dear [insert name]", if the name of the recruiter is unknown put down "dear hiring manager" or "dear recruiting team," or in the worst case, write "To whom it may concern," if you are unsure who will be reading your letter
              


              consists of a greeting, "dear [insert name]", if the name of the recruiter is unknown put down "dear hiring manager" or "dear recruiting team," or in the worst case, write "To whom it may concern," if you are unsure who will be reading your letter

              the opening paragraph is where you will mention the job you're applying for and how you found the job in question. This should be about 1 or 2 sentences

              Using 1 or 2 body paragraphs will help to keep the hiring manager engaged while also informing them of the needed info, use this space to answer questions such as "why am I qualified for this position?", "What experience do I have that fits the company's requirements as shown in the job listing", and "why do you want to work for this company?"

              For the final paragraph, restate why you're qualified for the job in a single sentence, followed by discussing what you'll be doing next, such as the exact day when you plan on following up with the hiring manager, or that you look forward to interviewing for the position

              Don't forget to mention that your resume and/or references are attached (if you have done so that is), and finally, thank the person for their time

              Finally, end the letter with your closing statement, you should close it like any other letter, such as "Sincerely [your signature here]"
              After writing your letter Review your cover letter for errors
