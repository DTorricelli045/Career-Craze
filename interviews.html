            <h2>Prepare for your big presentation</h2>
            <p>Before anything else, review your application and reread your resume and cover letter, try to memorize the important details you've written down if you haven't already. Next, you're gonna want to review the details of the job you're going after, find what your employer is looking for and take some notes based off their expectations and find ways to appeal to these criteria in your presentation to emphasis that you are a good fit for the job. Now that you have an idea of what you need to show at the interview, you can start forming a general introduction, the most important part of this is being <strong>Honest</strong> so that neither you or your employers are dissapointed after the fact. Try to think as your employer and see what they would like in an employee, what aspects fit the job, can they work with others, these are some general details an employer typically looks for. After you know what they want, you can ask yourself questions based on what you'd believe they'd ask you, answer these questions many times until you feel you've got a nice and concise answer that delivers your point, then write down an introduction with these answers. Finally, with your basic outline of your introduction made, read over it and write it into a paragraph introducing yourself, and condense that paragraph into a quick overview of yourself and keep in mind this is just a simple introduction and not a lecture of your life story. </p>

            <h2>Practice makes perfect</h2>
            <p>with your quick intro done, now you can practice for your interview, start by reading your introduction aloud until it feels natural to say, what's important here is that you memorize the key points of your intro, it's all right if you don't recite it word for word. Another good way to practice your intro is to record yourself doing an introduction or have a friend critique you, both can provide some insight you may overlook, adding to your overall success. Now you can write the main points of your intro onto an index card so you can reference it if necesarry and abovall else, stay calm and stay confident, sometimes the key to achieveing this is by simply not worrying about being calm and confident, but a little worry never hurts either, and if you're still worried, just think about how much you've prepared for this, and know that <i><strong>you can do this.</strong></i></p>

            <h2>End on a good Note</h2>
            <p>The time has come and you're about to head into the office to get interviewed, the first step is stepping into the room with confidence and without hesitation after you're called in. When you first meet your reviewer or "reviewers" make sure to give each one a firm handshake, yet not an overpowering grip either, give them a smile and a simple "Hi, how are you?" can suffice for now, remember that these are humans too so you don't need to frontload them with your intro until they ask you for one. During the interview do your best to maintain eye contact with to keep an air of confidence about you, looking away during the interview will make you appear nervous or hesitant. When you are asked for your intro, present it just like you practiced, while it isn't good to pause, it's alright to take a brief breather every now and then. While presenting yourself, stick to the main points you practiced, try not to add any last minute details or ramble on about a subject for too long, if you're reviewers need or want more information, they'll be sure to ask you, so there's no need to worry. After your intro they'll probably ask you a few more questions related to the job or yourself, if you can't think of an answer on the spot to an unexpected question, that's ok, you can buy a little extra time by responding with some fluff context such as "that's a good question..." or "well if I had to say..." and think of the answer to the qustion <i>while</i> answering the question, as long as you avoid saying "um..." or something similar to it, you'll do pretty well. Lastly, if you make a mistake, it isn't the end of the world, remember, you're speaking with people too, everyone makes mistakes, so don't beat yourself up over a few stumbles or mispronunciations, just take a deep breath and continue like nothing happened.</p>
