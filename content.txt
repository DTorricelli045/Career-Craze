How to present yourself in a job interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>Interview
-Walk into the room confidently (don't hesitate when you're invited in)
-Shake your interviewer's hand, give a firm handshake, yet not a crushing grip
-Smile and act natural, you don't need to dive into your introduction until they asked
-Make eye contact with your interviewer, try not to look elsewhere as it will give the impression that you're nervous
-When you are asked to introduce yourself, go ahead and recite your introduction just like you've practiced, try not to pause this early on as it makes you appear unprepared
-Don't ramble, stick to the points you've made and try not to add on to it as you may end up sounding repetitive or nervous if you talk too long, if you're interviewer would like to know more, they will ask, so no need to worry
-Stay positive, don't beat yourself up over a small stutter or mistake
-if you need time to think before answering a question, don't say "um," instead say some filler like "that's a good question," and draw it out a bit while you think of your response

Tips for a successful job interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>Prep
-Review your Application
---reread your resume and cover letter to remind yourself of important details to bring up

-Review your job details
---Make sure to review what your employer is looking for and make notes of how to present these aspects in your introduction, giving the sense that you are well fit for the job

-Think of what your employers are looking for
---firstly, Make sure to be honest and be yourself, but try to think of professional aspects that you may excel in that your employers may be looking to hear, try to think like your employer when deciding which aspects are most important

-Prepare by asking yourself questions
---develop your introduction by asking yourself a few questions that you would normally be asked, such as who are you, why do you want this job, what skills do you possess, etc. and write them out into an introduction

-Write out your introduction
---condense all of the aspects you've just made into a short paragraph about 3-5 sentences, then condense and simplify it, your intro should be concise, yet thorough. Remember, this is a quick overview of yourself and not a 10 minute presentation of you.


->>>Practice
-Read your introduction aloud many times
-memorize key points of your presentation so you don't need to iterate your introduction word for word
-rehearse until the introduction sounds and feels like a normal conversation
-record yourself or ask a friend to critique you
-write your main points on an index card that is readily available for reference
-Be calm and confident, the trick to this is to not worry to much on being calm and confident and think back to how well you've prepared
